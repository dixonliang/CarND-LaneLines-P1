# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 

Overview
---

This was the first project in the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree. My write up is included with the raw Jupyter notebook output (containing code) in this respository. The main objective of this projet was to create a video of tracking the lane boundaries in a short video. My two video outputs are also included.
